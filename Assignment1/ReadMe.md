Context:
Your team was recently hired for a project on critical infrastructure protection to enhance resilience against cyber threats to critical infrastructure routinely relying on supervisory control for its continuous operation. Realizing that a security breach may be unavoidable, the novel risk mitigation approach taken here uses behaviour-based online intrusion detection by monitoring and analyzing control signals streamed in real time from the continuous operation of a cyber-physical system. The sample dataset made available is extracted from supervisory control data describing electricity consumption for households. Extended versions of the this dataset will be studied using increasingly advanced analytic methods as we progress through the term project. This is the first building block.

Submission:
Each group will receive its own CUSTOMIZED DATASET to be analyzed using the R language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.
