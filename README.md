# Term Project 
- Term Project DescriptionOur term project is a group project comprising three separate parts as detailed below. 

- Each group has two/three members working together as a project team.

- Project Deliverables:
  - Developing predictive models for behavioural anomaly based online intrusion detection by monitoring and analyzing control signals streamedin real time from the continuous operation of a cyber-physical system;
  - Project report: detailed description of the experiments performed, the results obtained and their comparison for determining the best predictive model(s);
  - Presentation slides: summarizing the essential findings from your report
